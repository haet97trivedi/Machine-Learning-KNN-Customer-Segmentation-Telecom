  <h1>Machine-Learning-KNN-Customer-Segmentation-Telecom</h1>
  <p>This repository presents a comprehensive project utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) supervised machine learning algorithm. The project aims to predict customer behavior based on demographic data, facilitating more effective customer segmentation for a telecommunications company.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a robust, intuitive machine learning algorithm that has been employed in this project to classify customers into four distinctive groups. These groups, referred to as Basic Service, E-Service, Plus Service, and Total Service, encapsulate patterns of service usage among customers. The classification is performed based on various demographic factors, such as region, age, and marital status.</p>

  <h2>Data Set</h2>
  <p>The project utilizes a detailed data set acquired from the IBM Developer Skills Network. The data, stored as a CSV file, encompasses demographic and service usage information for 1,000 customers belonging to a hypothetical telecommunications company. Each row in the file corresponds to an individual customer, and each column pertains to a unique attribute or characteristic of the customer.</p>

  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>Initially, the data is imported and normalized, ensuring it is in a suitable format for application of the KNN algorithm. Following this, the data is segregated into two groups: a training set and a testing set. This division aims to prevent overfitting and allows for the evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data. The KNN algorithm is then trained using a range of 'k' values, facilitating the selection of the most effective value. The most appropriate 'k' value is identified based on the level of accuracy it offers when tested on the testing data set.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Upon application of the project's methodology, it was discovered that the optimal 'k' value for this data set and problem scope was 9. This value provided the highest level of accuracy on the testing set. However, it is essential to note that this optimal 'k' value might differ depending on the unique attributes and size of a different data set or upon changes in the parameters of the project.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion and Impact</h2>
  <p>This project effectively demonstrates the practical application of the K-Nearest Neighbors machine learning algorithm. By classifying customers into specific categories based on an analysis of their demographic data, businesses such as telecommunications companies can gain a deeper understanding of their customer base. This understanding allows for the provision of more personalized and effective services, leading to enhanced customer satisfaction and retention rates and, consequently, improved business performance.</p>

  <h2>Benefits to the User</h2>
  <p>This project offers numerous benefits to individuals interested in machine learning and customer segmentation. Primarily, it showcases a practical application of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, offering users a deeper understanding of the algorithm's functionality. The project can also act as a learning tool for those who are new to machine learning, providing an example of an effective machine learning workflow.</p>
